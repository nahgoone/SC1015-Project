## Our Motivation
- The gaming industry has always been saturated with games and between 2010 and 2020, annual game industry revenue grew from $78 billion to $137 billion — more than either Hollywood or the American music industry.
- Steam was 1 such platform that was able to benefit from this trend, having a huge increase in influx of users from 8.4 million in 2015 to 33 million in 2023
- More people and developers are trying to capitalize on this trend, however, the average time to create a game, not to mention a successful one is difficult.
- One might need to take a few months, years, or even a decade to create a playable game. Creating a successful one is even more difficult. As a computer science student who’s also interested in developing games, this problem would be interesting to solve

## Project Goal
- Our project aims to maximize profits when producing Steam Games by predicting the 'success' probability before developing the game.

## Datasets Used
- All of the [Data](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pe-xQLG2WaZTIf8NbjC5G2nqP5fd9vBy) we have collected and used are in a Google Drive.

**2. Data Cleaning**

**3. EDA**

**4. Machine Learning**

**5. Learning Outcomes**

**6. Conclusion**
- Rather than trying to target a genre segment, developers should focus on ensuring their game is accessible, e.g. cheap/affordable, cross-platform, and popular via marketing and high perceived quality.
- Future works: Analyze various player demographics and preferences and make games catered to their targetted audience. 

## Key Takeaways: 
**Owners and Average Playtime:** 
- Games with a larger number of owners tend to have higher average playtimes. 

**Overall Reviews and Average Playtime**: 
- Games with more overall reviews, which can be indicative of popularity or player engagement, tend to have higher average playtimes. 
- Positive reviews might encourage more players to try the game, leading to longer play sessions or more frequent play. Conversely, negative reviews might deter players, resulting in shorter playtimes. 

**Price and Average Playtime**: 
- The relationship between price and average playtime can vary. 
- Generally, lower-priced games may attract more players due to affordability, potentially resulting in longer playtimes.  
- On the other hand, higher-priced games may have dedicated fan bases or offer premium content, leading to longer play sessions despite the higher cost. 
- Players may perceive higher-priced games as having higher value, motivating them to spend more time playing to justify the investment.

**Diverse Player Preferences**: 
- Video game genres cater to a wide range of player preferences and gaming experiences. 
- Some players may prefer short, intense sessions offered by action-packed games, while others may enjoy the immersive storytelling of role-playing games (RPGs) that lead to longer playtimes. 
- The diversity in player preferences leads to varying average playtimes across different genres, resulting in a weaker correlation between genre and playtime.
