## Our Motivation
- The gaming industry has always been saturated with games and between 2010 and 2020, annual game industry revenue grew from $78 billion to $137 billion — more than either Hollywood or the American music industry.
- Steam was 1 such platform that was able to benefit from this trend, having a huge increase in influx of users from 8.4 million in 2015 to 33 million in 2023
- More people and developers are trying to capitalize on this trend, however, the average time to create a game, not to mention a successful one is difficult.
- One might need to take a few months, years, or even a decade to create a playable game. Creating a successful one is even more difficult. As a computer science student who’s also interested in developing games, this problem would be interesting to solve

## Project Goal
- Our project aims to maximize profits when producing Steam Games by predicting the 'success' probability before developing the game.

## Datasets Used
- All of the [Data](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pe-xQLG2WaZTIf8NbjC5G2nqP5fd9vBy) we have collected and used are in a Google Drive.
